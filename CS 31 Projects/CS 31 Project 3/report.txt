1. An obstacle I had to overcome while working on project 3 was to plot characters on the grid when either starting values are negative. Without setting a code to ignore negative values, the program will terminate automatically because the negative values would not be part of the inputted grid values. I had trouble coming up with a solution so the error message would not pop up, but also plotting the points after r and c were not negative. 
2. function plotHoriztontalLine(r, c, distance, ch)
        Distance is 0 or positive
                Repeat:
                Check out of bounds
Add distance
                Plot character
                Break when i is distance


        Distance is negative
                Repeat:
                Check out of bounds
                Add distance
                Plot Character
                Break when i is distance


function plotVerticalLine(r, c, distance, ch)
        Distance is 0 or positive
                Repeat:
                Check out of bounds
                Add distance
                Plot character
                Break when i is distance
        Distance is negative
                Repeat:
                Check out of bounds
                Add distance
                Plot Character
                Break when i is distance
                
Setting unchanging values to variable 

function plotLine(r, c, distance, dir, plotChar, fgbg):

                plotHorizontalLine
        If mode is background
                Get character of c and r
                Plot if Char == “ “
        If vertical
                plotVerticalLine
        If mode is background
                Get character of c and r
                Plot if Char == “ “
        If parameters is not valid
                Do not run


function performCommands(commandString, plotChar, mode, badPos):
        Define variable with starting condition
        Repeat while the string index is less than command size: 
        Command becomes first letter
        Add 1 to index
        If next line is not specified letter
                Note the index
                Return 1 for syntax error
        If next line is not plottable or valid mode
                Note the index
                Return 2 for invalid plot character or mode
        If command starts with number
                Note the index
                Return 1 for syntax error
        If command is ‘H’ or ‘h’
                Set distance to 0
                If ‘-’ follows
                        Check up to 2 digits following
                If is number
                        Check the next digit
                Add the digits following to distance
                Check if distance stays inside the grid
                        If true add distance to x value
                        If false return 3 for out of bounds
                If it does not align with any of these, return 1
        If command is ‘V’ or ‘v’
                Set distance to 0
                If ‘-’ follows
                        Check up to 2 digits following
                If is number
                        Check the next digit
                Add the digits following to distance

                If it does not align with any of these, return 1
        If command is ‘F’ or ‘f’
                Set the mode to foreground
                Take the next character as the new character to plot
                Add 1 to index
        If command is ‘B’ or ‘b’
                Check if next character is valid and if the mode is background
                If false return 2 for invalid character
                If true take character as the new character to plot
                Add 1 to index
                If it does not match return 1 for syntax error
        If command is ‘C’ or ‘c’
                Clear the grid
                Set current position, character, and mode to default
                If it does not match return 1 for syntax error
