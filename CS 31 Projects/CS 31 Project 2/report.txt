1. An obstacle I had to overcome while working on project 2 was writing correct boolean expressions in the if statements. For example, I kept comparing the overstated amount with 90 to calculate for fines that exceeded 150, when I should be comparing the overstated amount with 150. This led to small calculation errors, which took me a while to spot when troubleshooting. 
2.    1. Empty string for identification (“”, 150, “scotland”)
To test the error message, “You must enter a property identification.” is outputted when an empty string is inputted for identification.
   2. Identification and location provided, but overstated amount is not positive (“Lodge Miami”, -150, “scotland”)
To test the error message, “The overstated amount must be positive.” is outputted when the overstated amount is negative.
   3. Empty string for location (“Lodge Miami”, 150, “”)
To test the error message, “You must enter a location.” is outputted when an empty string is inputted for location.
   4. Overstated amount is less than $60 (“Lodge Miami”, 45, “scotland”)
To test if fines for overstated amounts under the first $60 million is calculated correctly
   5. Overstated amount is greater than or equal to $60 (“Lonely Lodge”, 72, “scotland”)
To test if fines for overstated amounts above or equal to $60 million is calculated correctly
   6. Overstated amount is less than or equal to 150 (“Lonely Lodge”, 120, “scotland”)
To test if fines for overstated amounts less than or equal to $90 million is calculated correctly
   7. Overstated amount is greater than or equal to $60 and location is “florida” or “new york” (“Lodge Miami”, 110, “florida”)
To test if fines for overstated amounts less than or equal to $150 million is multiplied by 18% (florida and new york values) correctly
   8. Overstated amount is greater than or equal to $60 and less than or equal to 150 and location is not “florida” or “new york” (“Lonely Lodge
   9.  ”, 110, “scotland”)
To test if fines for overstated amounts less than or equal to $150 million is calculated correctly without processing the 18%
   10. Overstated amount is greater than $150 (“Lonely Lodgei”, 192, “scotland”)
To test if fines for overstated amounts greater than $90 million is calculated correctly
